## Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/casetext/ansel-challenge
cd ansel-challenge
npm install
```

In test/data, you'll find three different snippets of legal text. In test/results
you'll find legal citations separated by newlines. Your goal is to implement the
```LegalTokenizer#next()``` method so that, when given the chunk of text in 
test/data/<name>, it returns the citations in test/results/<name> in the correct order.

Make all changes on a git branch called ```"applicant/<github handle>"```.

A test suite is already present. To validate your code, run "npm test".
If the tests pass, your code works and you can submit to us.

To submit your code, file a pull request with your branch against the repository.

## Hints

*Do not* modify any file in ```./test``` without first asking us.

You can organize the code in the project however you like and use whatever third-party
libraries you need, but be prepared to defend your decisions.

We are most likely to be impressed by lucid, readable, well-factored code that
solves the problem in a comprehensible way.
